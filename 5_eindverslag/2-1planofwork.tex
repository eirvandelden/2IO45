\chapter{Plan of Work} % (fold)
\label{cha:plan_of_work}
    Because we cannot predict how much work goes into each part of the development of Bomb3D, we set an internal deadline to finish products. This deadline is one week before the official deadline. This also gives us the opportunity to receive feedback on documents. What we would like to do, is hand in products two weeks in advance, but time will tell if we can reach those goals. \\

%    Zodra we beter denken te kunnen voorspellen waar de moeilijkheden liggen binnen de opdracht (netwerkcomponent, grafische component, of ergens anders) kunnen we de planning daarop aanpassen, maar die informatie hebben we nu nog niet.

    \section{Deciding about the type of game} % (fold)
    \label{sec:decisions_about_the_game}
        To help determine the type of game we will make, we held a brainstorm session. This session was split in two parts, the first to chose a genre, the second to determine a play-style or game we would replicate.

\section{Reflection} % (fold)
\label{sec:reflection}
    During the entire project, the exact roles of everyone changed a lot. This was due to changing priorities and people helping out with other parts of code. Documentation is the prime example, everyone has worked on their own part of documentation and sometimes on the whole document, or someone else took over documentation so that more people could code the game.

    During this OGO we had to make a network distributed 3D game, with a synchronisation demand. We have chosen after a brainstorm session to implement our own version of Bomberman (called Bomb3D), a multiplayer game by Hudson Soft. In Bomb3D, players must destroy each other, by first destroying soft walls that can reveal power-ups. These power-ups must be synchronized, when player A picks it up, no other player can pick it up again. With this decision, we differentiate from the original food gathering demand, but keep the synchronisation problems.

This document combines all our previous delivered documents. It shows from start to end how we designed Bomb3D, as well as the division of work between team members. You can also find our specification, a list of design decisions and alternatives to the implementation. Some sections have been added which descibe our reflections on the old documents, with an evaluation section added at the very end of this new document.

# Bomberman3D
For the course 2IO45 we have developed, in 2008-2009, our own network capable 3d Bomberman!
Not only is it playable, it has everything you need in a bomber man game: upgrades, destructible blocks and sound based on location!
And an iconic theme song ;)

See 4_implementatiefase/Bomb3D Manual.pdf on how to start the game.
